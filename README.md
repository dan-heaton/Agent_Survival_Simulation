# CPP-Project

## Project Stages Overview
The project will proceed along several stages. The broad goal will be to create an environment(s) whereupon multiple agents interact with each other and the environment as independent entities seeking survival and duplication, a la natural selection. The stages are imagined as follows:

0.1.x - Setup of basic environment with basic agents (few varieties) exhibiting simple self-preservation behaviour
0.2.x - Addition of multiple agent types, more features of environment, more environment varieties, and more advanced self-preservation behaviour
1.0.x - Addition of replication of agents (using principles from genetic algorithms), time controls, and 2D real-time visual representation of agents in environment
2.0.x - Replace pre-written agent behaviour rules with principles from reinforcement learning
